# Family Tree Scheme Project

## 📘 Project Overview

This project implements a **Family Tree System** in the **Scheme** programming language, developed in pair. 
It models maternal and paternal branches of a family and provides multiple functions to process, query, and manipulate family data such as:

- Listing all members in both branches  
- Identifying parents and children  
- Calculating ages and average ages at death  
- Sorting and filtering by names and birthdays  
- Modifying records (e.g., changing a person’s name)

The program demonstrates recursion, higher-order functions, list processing, and functional programming techniques in Scheme.

## 🧩 Features

### **Shared Features (Both Partners)**
- Combine maternal and paternal branches  
- Return all members in the family tree (`C1–C3`)

### **Partner A**
- Extract all parents from the tree (`A1`)  
- Find all living members (`A2`)  
- Calculate current ages (`A3`)  
- List members with birthdays in a given month (`A4`)  
- Sort family members by last name (`A5`)  
- Change a member’s first name (`A6`)

### **Partner B**
- Retrieve all children in the family tree (`B1`)  
- Find the oldest living member (`B2`)  
- Calculate the average age at death (`B3`)  
- Filter members with the same birthday month (`B4`)  
- Sort by first name (`B5`)  
- Recursively change a name anywhere in the structure (`B6`)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Racket / Scheme (`.rkt` file)
- **Paradigm:** Functional programming
- **Main Concepts:** Recursion, list processing, higher-order functions, and data abstraction

## 🚀 How to Run the Program

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd family-tree-scheme
```
Run the main file using Racket:

```bash
racket family_tree_code.rkt
```
## 🧠 Summary

This project demonstrates functional programming and data abstraction through a detailed implementation of a family tree system in Scheme.  
It allows exploration of relationships, sorting, filtering, and data manipulation entirely using recursive and declarative techniques.
