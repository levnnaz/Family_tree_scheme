# Family Tree System (Scheme Implementation)

## Project Overview

This project is a **Family Tree Handling System** implemented in Scheme. It allows users to manage and query family data for both **maternal and paternal branches**. The system provides functions to retrieve family members, compute ages, find birthdays, sort names, and update personal information.

## Features

The system provides the following functions:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **C1** | List all members in the Maternal Branch. |
| **C2** | List all members in the Paternal Branch. |
| **C3** | List all members in both branches combined. |
| **A1** | List all parents from a branch. |
| **A2** | List living members of a branch. |
| **A3** | Calculate current age of living members. |
| **A4** | Find members with birthdays in a specific month. |
| **A5** | Sort members by last name. |
| **A6** | Change the first name of a member. |
| **B1** | List children of members in a branch. |
| **B2** | Find the oldest living member in a branch. |
| **B3** | Calculate the average age at death of members. |
| **B4** | Find members with birthdays in a specific month (branch-specific). |
| **B5** | Sort members by first name. |
| **B6** | Change a personâ€™s first name recursively in the branch. |
